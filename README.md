# Terrorism Analysis with Tableau & Power BI üìä

A comprehensive data visualization project analyzing global terrorism patterns using both Tableau and Power BI. This project offers dual perspectives on terrorism data through interactive dashboards and detailed visualizations.

## üìà Project Overview

This project provides in-depth analysis of global terrorism trends through eight distinct visualizations, implemented in both Tableau and Power BI. The analysis covers geographical patterns, terrorist group activities, attack types, and casualty statistics.

## üéØ Features

### Tableau Visualizations

#### 1. Global Terrorism Heatmap
- World map visualization with color gradient intensity
- Dynamic year-based filtering
- Color gradients representing attack frequency
- Interactive country-specific details

#### 2. Top 10 Terrorist Groups Analysis
- Stacked area chart showing group activities over time
- Color-coded areas for different groups
- Temporal trend analysis
- Detailed group activity patterns

#### 3. Attack Types and Casualties Scatter Plot
- X-axis: Number of fatalities
- Y-axis: Number of wounded
- Color-coded by attack type
- Point sizing based on total casualties
- Hover functionality for detailed information

#### 4. Monthly Trend Dashboard
- Integrated dashboard with:
  - Monthly incidents line chart
  - Attack types bar chart
  - Top 5 affected countries table
- Cross-filtering functionality
- Interactive elements for data exploration

### Power BI Visualizations

#### 1. Geospatial Analysis
- Interactive map using latitude/longitude data
- Bubble visualization for casualty representation
- Year and region filtering capabilities
- Coastal region focus for Australian terrorism incidents

#### 2. Terrorist Group Metrics
- Multi-row card visual for top 5 groups
- Key metrics display:
  - Total attacks
  - Total casualties
  - Success rates
- Timeline slicer for temporal analysis

#### 3. Weapon Type Analysis
- Hierarchical treemap visualization
- Color intensity representing weapon lethality
- Drill-down capability for weapon subtypes
- Notable focus on incendiary weapons impact

#### 4. Target Analysis Dashboard
- Multiple visualization types:
  - Donut chart for target distribution
  - Clustered column chart for casualties
  - Detailed target frequency table
- Bookmark functionality for different data views
